## About our API assignment
his web app allows users to browse and view detailed information about Star Wars characters. It dynamically fetches data from the Star Wars API (SWAPI) and displays character images, descriptions, and other key details. Users can search for characters, view their details, and even watch a related movie trailer.
## Features
Character List: Displays a grid of characters fetched from the SWAPI.
Character Details: When a character is clicked, detailed information including name, gender, height, hair color, and skin color is shown.
Character Images: Fetches character images based on their name from an external source.
Movie Trailer: Watch a YouTube trailer related to the character.
Search Functionality: Search for characters by name with a live search feature.
## How It Works
On page load, the app fetches a list of characters from the SWAPI.
The user can search for a character by typing in the search box, filtering the character list.
Clicking on a character displays detailed information, including an image, description, and a movie trailer button.
Clicking the "Movie Trailer" button displays a trailer in an embedded iframe.
A back button allows navigation back to the character list.
## Reflection
Working on the Star Wars Character Viewer was fun, but we had some challenges along the way. The movie trailer feature gave us trouble at first. The trailer wouldn't load properly, and we couldnâ€™t figure out why. We spent a lot of time trying to fix it.

Even though it was tough, our team stuck together and kept working on it. In the end, we got the trailer to work, and the app turned out great. It was a lot of hard work, but it was worth it. We're proud of what we did and happy we pushed through the problems together.
